<h3> Frequency Visualizer in C/C++ </h3>


For this project, the goal is to create an audio visualizer using C/C++. 


1) What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.

2) What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project?

3) What do you need to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help?

4) What are your first steps?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you can do immediately, and identify which member of the team will do them.  For each one, what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done?
